## üöÄ Getting Started

Ready to run Kickxz locally and contribute? Follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) -  Install the Flutter SDK for your operating system.
*   [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart) - Dart comes bundled with Flutter, but ensure it's correctly set up.
*   [Serverpod CLI](https://pub.dev/packages/serverpod_cli) - Install the Serverpod command-line tools:
    ```bash
    dart pub global activate serverpod_cli
    ```
*   [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - Install Docker Desktop for your operating system.
*   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) - Docker Compose is usually bundled with Docker Desktop, but ensure it's installed.
*   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) -  Choose your preferred IDE with Flutter and Dart extensions/plugins installed respectively.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/turkananation/kickxz.git
    cd kickxz
    ```

2.  **Install Flutter dependencies (client app - The SDK to connect to the backend generated by Serverpod):**
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_client
    flutter pub get
    ```

3.  **Install Flutter dependencies (flutter app - The main app built using flutter and consuming data from the backend):**
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_flutter # Corrected path to kickxz_flutter
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Install Serverpod dependencies (server - The backend with models and endpoints connecting to database used to also generate the client SDK):**
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_server
    dart pub get
    ```

5.  **Generate Serverpod code:**
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_server
    serverpod generate
    ```

6.  **Start PostgreSQL and Redis with Docker Compose:**
    Serverpod uses Docker Compose to manage the PostgreSQL and Redis databases.  Run the following command from the `kickxz_server` directory to pull and start these services in detached mode:
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_server
    docker compose up --build --detach
    ```
    This command will download the necessary Docker images for PostgreSQL and Redis and start them in the background.

7.  **Run database migrations:**
    Once the Docker containers are running, apply the database migrations to set up the database schema:
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_server
    dart bin/main.dart --apply-migrations
    ```
    This command will apply the necessary database migrations by building the database with the required tables and everything set.
    It will also be a streaming terminal (Keep this terminal window running in the background) to keep the server connection open.

### Running the App

1.  **Start the Serverpod backend:**
    With the databases running via Docker Compose, start the Serverpod backend application assuming all migrations is applied otherwise use step 7 above:
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_server
    dart bin/main.dart 
    ```
    It will also be a streaming terminal (Keep this terminal window running in the background) to keep the server connection open.

2.  **Run the Flutter app:**
    ```bash
    cd kickxz_flutter
    flutter run
    ```
    Choose your target device or emulator (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop).
